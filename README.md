**About Rave WBL Placemet Platform**

Rave WBL Placement Platform is a job vacancy system designed for students at Ravensbourne University that are enrolled in WBL (Work Based Learning). WBL is available for Year 2 students and it allows students to work in a professional industry, gaining exeprience in how to handle projects and how to communicate and manage work schedules, where students are given the chance to showcase their knowledge and skills.

I chose to develop this system as my final project to support students in finding jobs related to their fields of study, such as Computer Science, Fashion, CyberSecurity and more. Additionally, the sytsem helps staff track student job application form progress, where if students is unsuccessfull in job application, then staff will be aware and provide an additionall project to student.
